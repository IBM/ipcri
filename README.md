# IBM Power Cryptography Reference Implementation

## About

### What this is

This repository contains snippets of code that can be used as a baseline for optimized cryptographic algorithms on POWER.
These BSD-2-Clause licensed implementations can be adapted into existing codebases, cryptography libraries, etc.

### What this is **not**

This repository is **NOT** intended to be a standalone cryptography library, or a replacement for any crypto library currently available.
Binaries produced by this library are for testing purposely only and should not be considered to have a stable interface.
